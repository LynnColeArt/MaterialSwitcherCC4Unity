# Material Switcher

This unity plugin exists to address the problem of working with cc4 decoys and VRM's.
The cc4 hdrp tool set for unity provides an exciting way to make your cc4 models look incredible in unity under the hdrp scripted pipeline. But, that doesn't help you if your goal is turn your cc4 character into an interactive vrm for use in vseeface or similar software. Indeed, the stock materials for VRM's are not hdrp compatible. 

The process of converting between your baked cc4 character and your vrm, up until now has been a long manual process that's prone to error, and very time consuming. 

Material Switcher automates the process, taking it from hours of tedious work down to a few clicks.

## Instructions
1. Drop the Material Switcher into your project files.
2. Adding the package to your Unity project will create a tools->material switcher menu option. Click it
3. In the dialog, select your source and desination models. Then click the button, and you're done.
